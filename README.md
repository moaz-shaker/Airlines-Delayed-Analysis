# Airlines Delayed 2008 - Power BI Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of U.S. airline delays in the year 2008. Using Power BI, we explored around 2 million flight records to uncover trends, causes of delays, cancellations, and diversions. The interactive dashboards provide actionable insights for improving airline operations and passenger experience.

## Project Objectives

- Visualize and analyze large-scale flight delay data for 2008.
- Identify the most frequent causes of delays and cancellations.
- Understand patterns across time, carriers, and airports.
- Create a report structure using bookmarks to improve user navigation.
- Share insights via Power BI Report Server or GitHub.

## Dataset Description

- **Source:** U.S. Department of Transportation â€“ Bureau of Transportation Statistics  
- **Year:** 2008  
- **Size:** Over 7 million flight records  
- **Features include:**  
  - Flight dates, times, distances  
  - Delay causes (weather, carrier, NAS, security, late aircraft)  
  - Cancellations and diversions  
  - Airports and carrier codes  

---

## Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop** (visualization & modeling)  
- **Power Query** (data cleaning & transformation)  
- **DAX** (for calculated measures and KPIs)  
- **Power BI Report Server** (deployment)  

---

## Data Preparation & Modeling

We used Power Query to clean and transform the raw datasets. Several dimension tables were created for a star schema model, including:

- `DimCarrier`
- `DimAirport`
- `DimDate`
- `DimFlightStatus`

A fact table (`FactFlights`) holds the flight-level data.

## Dashboard Pages

### 1. General Analysis

This page provides a high-level overview of flight performance:

- Total flights, on-time, delayed, cancelled, and diverted flights.
- Monthly trends and airline comparisons.
- Geographic distribution of affected flights.

### 2. Cancellation & Diversion Analysis

This view focuses on identifying:

- Primary causes of flight cancellations (weather, carrier, etc.).
- Distribution of diverted flights across airports and airlines.

### 3. Delay Analysis

This section breaks down delay causes:

- Average delay time by cause (weather, carrier, etc.)
- Delay patterns by airline, airport, and day of the week.
- Visuals include bar charts, boxplots, and heatmaps.
